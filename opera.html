        ACT II.
                           SCENE.—Ko-Ko's Garden.

  Yum-Yum discovered seated at her bridal toilet, surrounded by
       maidens, who are dressing her hair and painting her face and
       lips, as she judges of the effect in a mirror.

                    SOLO—PITTI-SING and CHORUS OF GIRLS.

  CHORUS.        Braid the raven hair—
                      Weave the supple tress—
                 Deck the maiden fair
                      In her loveliness—
                 Paint the pretty face—
                      Dye the coral lip—
                 Emphasize the grace
                      Of her ladyship!
                 Art and nature, thus allied,
                 Go to make a pretty bride.

                           SOLO—PITTI-SING.

                 Sit with downcast eye
                      Let it brim with dew—
                 Try if you can cry—
                      We will do so, too.
                 When you're summoned, start
                      Like a frightened roe—
                 Flutter, little heart,
                      Colour, come and go!
                 Modesty at marriage-tide
                 Well becomes a pretty bride!

                               CHORUS.

                 Braid the raven hair, etc.

                                     [Exeunt Pitti-Sing, Peep-Bo, and
  Chorus.

       YUM.  Yes, I am indeed beautiful!  Sometimes I sit and
  wonder, in my artless Japanese way, why it is that I am so much
  more attractive than anybody else in the whole world.  Can this
  be vanity?  No!  Nature is lovely and rejoices in her loveliness.
  I am a child of Nature, and take after my mother.

                            SONG—YUM-YUM.

                 The sun, whose rays
                 Are all ablaze
                      With ever-living glory,
                 Does not deny
                 His majesty—
                      He scorns to tell a story!
                 He don't exclaim,
                      "I blush for shame,
                      So kindly be indulgent."
                 But, fierce and bold,
                 In fiery gold,
                      He glories effulgent!

                      I mean to rule the earth,
                           As he the sky—
                      We really know our worth,
                           The sun and I!

                 Observe his flame,
                 That placid dame,
                      The moon's Celestial Highness;
                 There's not a trace
                 Upon her face
                      Of diffidence or shyness:
                 She borrows light
                 That, through the night,
                      Mankind may all acclaim her!
                 And, truth to tell,
                 She lights up well,
                      So I, for one, don't blame her!

                      Ah, pray make no mistake,
                           We are not shy;
                      We're very wide awake,
                           The moon and I!

                   Enter Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo.

       YUM.  Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
  married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
  happiest girl in Japan!
       PEEP.  The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
  envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
       YUM.  In "all but" perfection?
       PEEP.  Well, dear, it can't be denied that the fact that
  your husband is to be beheaded in a month is, in its way, a
  drawback.  It does seem to take the top off it, you know.
       PITTI.  I don't know about that.  It all depends!
       PEEP.  At all events, he will find it a drawback.
       PITTI.  Not necessarily.  Bless you, it all depends!
       YUM.  (in tears).  I think it very indelicate of you to
  refer to such a subject on such a day.  If my married happiness
  is to be—to be—
       PEEP.  Cut short.
       YUM.  Well, cut short—in a month, can't you let me forget
  it?  (Weeping.)

                 Enter Nanki-Poo, followed by Go-To.

       NANK.  Yum-Yum in tears—and on her wedding morn!
       YUM.  (sobbing).  They've been reminding me that in a month
  you're to be beheaded!  (Bursts into tears.)
       PITTI.  Yes, we've been reminding her that you're to be
  beheaded.  (Bursts into tears.)
       PEEP.  It's quite true, you know, you are to be beheaded!
  (Bursts into tears.)
       NANK.  (aside).  Humph!  Now, some bridegrooms would be
  depressed by this sort of thing!  (Aloud.)  A month?  Well,
  what's a month?  Bah!  These divisions of time are purely
  arbitrary.  Who says twenty-four hours make a day?
       PITTI.  There's a popular impression to that effect.
       NANK.  Then we'll efface it.  We'll call each second a
  minute—each minute an hour—each hour a day—and each day a
  year.  At that rate we've about thirty years of married happiness
  before us!
       PEEP.  And, at that rate, this interview has already lasted
  four hours and three-quarters!
                                                               [Exit
  Peep-Bo.
       YUM.  (still sobbing).  Yes.  How time flies when one is
  thoroughly enjoying oneself!
       NANK.  That's the way to look at it!  Don't let's be
  downhearted!  There's a silver lining to every cloud.
       YUM.  Certainly.  Let's—let's be perfectly happy!  (Almost
  in tears.)
       GO-TO.  By all means.  Let's—let's thoroughly enjoy
  ourselves.
       PITTI.  It's—it's absurd to cry!  (Trying to force a
  laugh.)
       YUM.  Quite ridiculous!  (Trying to laugh.)

                (All break into a forced and melancholy laugh.)

                                  MADRIGAL.

                YUM-YUM, PITTI-SING, NANKI-POO, and PISH-TUSH

            Brightly dawns our wedding day;
                 Joyous hour, we give thee greeting!
                 Whither, whither art thou fleeting?
            Fickle moment, prithee stay!
                 What though mortal joys be hollow?
                 Pleasures come, if sorrows follow:
            Though the tocsin sound, ere long,
                 Ding dong!  Ding dong!
            Yet until the shadows fall
            Over one and over all,
            Sing a merry madrigal—
                                A madrigal!

            Fal-la—fal-la! etc.  (Ending in tears.)

            Let us dry the ready tear,
                 Though the hours are surely creeping
                 Little need for woeful weeping,
            Till the sad sundown is near.
                 All must sip the cup of sorrow—
                 I to-day and thou to-morrow;
            This the close of every song—
                 Ding dong!  Ding dong!
            What, though solemn shadows fall,
            Sooner, later, over all?
            Sing a merry madrigal—
                                A madrigal!

            Fal-la—fal-la! etc.  (Ending in tears.)

                                            [Exeunt Pitti-Sing and
  Pish-Tush.

  (Nanki-Poo embraces Yum-Yum.  Enter Ko-Ko.  Nanki-Poo releases
       Yum-Yum.)

       KO.  Go on—don't mind me.
       NANK.  I'm afraid we're distressing you.
       KO.  Never mind, I must get used to it.  Only please do it
  by degrees.  Begin by putting your arm round her waist.
  (Nanki-Poo does so.)  There; let me get used to that first.
       YUM.  Oh, wouldn't you like to retire?  It must pain you to
  see us so affectionate together!
       KO.  No, I must learn to bear it!  Now oblige me by allowing
  her head to rest on your shoulder.
       NANK.  Like that?  (He does so.  Ko-Ko much affected.)
       KO.  I am much obliged to you.  Now—kiss her!  (He does so.
  Ko-Ko writhes with anguish.)  Thank you—it's simple torture!
       YUM.  Come, come, bear up.  After all, it's only for a
  month.
       KO.  No.  It's no use deluding oneself with false hopes.
       NANK. and YUM.  What do you mean?
       KO.  (to Yum-Yum).  My child—my poor child!  (Aside.)  How
  shall I break it to her?  (Aloud.)  My little bride that was to
  have been?
       YUM.  (delighted).  Was to have been?
       KO.  Yes, you never can be mine!
       NANK. and YUM. (simultaneously, in ecstacy)  What!/I'm so
  glad!
       KO.  I've just ascertained that, by the Mikado's law, when a
  married man is beheaded his wife is buried alive.
       NANK. and YUM.  Buried alive!
       KO.  Buried alive.  It's a most unpleasant death.
       NANK.  But whom did you get that from?
       KO.  Oh, from Pooh-Bah.  He's my Solicitor.
       YUM.  But he may be mistaken!
       KO.  So I thought; so I consulted the Attorney General, the
  Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the Judge Ordinary,
  and the Lord Chancellor.  They're all of the same opinion.  Never
  knew such unanimity on a point of law in my life!
       NANK.  But stop a bit!  This law has never been put in
  force.
       KO.  Not yet.  You see, flirting is the only crime
  punishable with decapitation, and married men never flirt.
       NANK.  Of course, they don't.  I quite forgot that!  Well, I
  suppose I may take it that my dream of happiness is at an end!
       YUM.  Darling—I don't want to appear selfish, and I love
  you with all my heart—I don't suppose I shall ever love anybody
  else half as much—but when I agreed to marry you—my own—I had
  no idea—pet—that I should have to be buried alive in a month!
       NANK.  Nor I!  It's the very first I've heard of it!
       YUM.  It—it makes a difference, doesn't it?
       NANK.  It does make a difference, of course.
       YUM.  You see—burial alive—it's such a stuffy death!
       NANK.  I call it a beast of a death.
       YUM.  You see my difficulty, don't you?
       NANK.  Yes, and I see my own.  If I insist on your carrying
  out your promise, I doom you to a hideous death; if I release
  you, you marry Ko-Ko at once!

                  TRIO.—YUM-YUM, NANKI-POO, and KO-KO.

  YUM.           Here's a how-de-do!
                 If I marry you,
            When your time has come to perish,
            Then the maiden whom you cherish
                 Must be slaughtered, too!
                 Here's a how-de-do!

  NANK.          Here's a pretty mess!
                 In a month, or less,
            I must die without a wedding!
            Let the bitter tears I'm shedding
                 Witness my distress,
                 Here's a pretty mess!

  KO.            Here's a state of things
                 To her life she clings!
            Matrimonial devotion
            Doesn't seem to suit her notion—
                 Burial it brings!
                 Here's a state of things!
