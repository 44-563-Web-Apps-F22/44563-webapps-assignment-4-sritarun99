               Yes, everything seems to smile upon me.  I am to be
               married to-day to the man I love best and I believe I am the very
               happiest girl in Japan!
               PEEP.  The happiest girl indeed, for she is indeed to be
               envied who has attained happiness in all but perfection.
               YUM.  In "all but" perfection?
               PEEP.  Well, dear, it can't be denied that the fact that
               your husband is to be beheaded in a month is, in its way, a
               drawback.  It does seem to take the top off it, you know.
               I don't know about that.  It all depends!
               At all events, he will find it a drawback.
               Not necessarily.  Bless you, it all depends!
               I think it very indelicate of you to
               refer to such a subject on such a day.  If my married happiness
               is to be—to be—
               Cut short. Well, cut short—in a month, can't you let me forget
               it?

               Then we'll efface it.  We'll call each second a
               minute—each minute an hour—each hour a day—and each day a
               year.  At that rate we've about thirty years of married happiness
               before us!
               PEEP.  And, at that rate, this interview has already lasted
               four hours and three-quarters!

               Fickle moment, prithee stay!
               What though mortal joys be hollow?
               Pleasures come, if sorrows follow:
               Though the tocsin sound, ere long,
               Ding dong!  Ding dong!
               Yet until the shadows fall
               Over one and over all,
               Sing a merry madrigal—
               A madrigal!
               Fal-la—fal-la! etc.  (Ending in tears.)
               Let us dry the ready tear,
               Though the hours are surely creeping
               Little need for woeful weeping,
               Till the sad sundown is near.
               All must sip the cup of sorrow—
               I to-day and thou to-morrow;
               This the close of every song—
               Ding dong!  Ding dong!
               What, though solemn shadows fall,
               Sooner, later, over all?
               Sing a merry madrigal—
               A madrigal!
               Fal-la—fal-la! etc.
